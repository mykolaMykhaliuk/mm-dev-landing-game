1. In Battle Zone killing bugs give 20 point, but should be 10 same as on city map.

2. In Battle Zone bugs can go through walls, can you make them not possible to go through walls.

3. In battle Zone player hits some invisible wall bottom, can you check why

4. In battle Zone camera is very high, can you make same as in other Buildings.

5. Make respawn for bugs depends on score, if its more, bugs respawn at more count.

FIXED:
